# cppMastery
This is a repository I will be using to practice my mastery of C++ and possibly exploring advanced computer vision operations. 

# Week 1
The goal for this week is to review the basics of cpp and then I will try to solve some basic leetcode questions to get a better understanding.

Day 1(5/12)
So I reviewed basic print and input code statements, now I'm going to review the leetcode questions.

Day 2(5/13)
New objective is to complete the entire neetcode 150 in cpp so that I am able to get experience with all data structues. My second goal is to start using OOP practice assignments to develop OOP principles in CPP to get an overall better understanding.
